General Things
Instead of having a ton of headers included at the top of your .c file, 
put them in the corresponding .h file for the .c you are working in. It
makes things much cleaner

If a function does not NEED to be public, make it private (static) and
do not include a prototype for it in the header

If you have a line that needs to be filled in later add a comment
"//TODO: thingToDo" on that line

Do not merge with master if you haven't done module testing/compiled everything
